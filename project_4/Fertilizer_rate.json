# ðŸŽ« Ticket â€“ Fertilizer Application Rate Resets to 0

**Title:** `[Bug] Fertilizer application standard rate resets to 0 when switching to planting`

**Description:**  
When creating a fertilizer map and entering a standard application rate (e.g., `100`), the value resets to `0` if the user switches to the **Planting** option and then back to **Fertilizer application**. This causes data loss and requires users to re-enter values.

**Steps to Reproduce:**  
1. Log in at `https://www.agmeo.com/sign-in`  
2. Navigate to **Fields â†’ Crop rotation â†’ Operations**  
3. Open a season (e.g., *Season 2023*)  
4. Go to **Fertilizer application**  
5. Click **Create fertilizer map**  
6. Enter `100` in **Standard rate** field  
7. Switch from **Fertilizer application** to **Planting**  
8. Switch back to **Fertilizer application**  

**Expected Result:**  
- The previously entered **Standard rate** (e.g., `100`) should persist when returning to **Fertilizer application**.  

**Actual Result:**  
- The **Standard rate** field resets to `0`.  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Standard rate persists when switching between **Planting** and **Fertilizer application**  
- [ ] No unintended reset of user-entered values  
- [ ] Regression test added to ensure values are preserved  

**Attachments:**  
- Playwright test covering the scenario (see code snippet provided)  
- Screenshot/video showing rate reset  

**Priority:** P1 (High â€“ critical workflow broken for fertilizer planning)
